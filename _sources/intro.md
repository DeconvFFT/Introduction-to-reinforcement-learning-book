# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

## What is reinforcement learning?
Reinforcement Learning is a study of agents and how they learn by trial and error. An agent takes an action and recieves a reward/punishment which makes the agent more likely to repeat or forgo that behaviour in the future.

## Key Concepts
The main characters in Reinforcement Learning are the agent and the environment. Environment is the world that the agent interacts with. At every step, the agent sees an observation(maybe partial)
of the state of the environment and decides to take an action. The action changes the state of the environment and the agent recieves a reward signal. The reward signal tells the agent how good or bad the current state of the environment is. The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward (also called **return**).
